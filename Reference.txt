Webapps 
----
  1. Server Side Rendering Apps (SSR)
      * page refresh 
      * traditional webapps 

  2. Client Side Rendering Apps (CSR)
      * pages will not refresh 
      * modern webapps 

      CSR = SPA (Front End Project) + REST API (Back End Project) 

      SPA (Single Page Apps)
      -------
        7 Characteristics

          #2 VueJS (framework)
          #3 Angular (framework -- To learn)
          #4 SvelteJS 

Browser
----
  1. HTML Renderer 
  2. CSS Parser 
  3. JS Engine 
      var x = 10;

    
TypeScript 
----
  TS => (TSC) => JS 


Naming Conventions & Casing Conventions 
----
Casing Types 
  --------
    1. PascalCase 
        * Recommended for Object Oriented Program's classes 
        * also Recommended for Interface in Java & TypeScript 

        examples 
        ---
          class CarDetails {

          }

          interface Employee {

          }

    2. camelCase 
        * Recommended for variables, const, functions, methods in JS & TS 
        * Recommended for id's of html 

        examples 
        -----
          var myCar = 'BMW';

          function getCarInfo() {
            //....
          }
    
    3. kebab-case
        * Recommended for URLs 
        * Recommended for file names, folder names (if not react), assets in front end projects 
        * Recommended for css classes 
        * okay for id's of html elements if your architect says okay

        examples 
        -----
          btn-primary
          slideshow-container 
          youtube-logo.png 

    4. snake_case
        * never ever use this. 
        * okay for const in JS & TS if architect accepts

        examples
        ---
          const MAX_STUDENTS_PER_CLASS = 30;

How to setup ESLint?
===
  ng add @angular-eslint/schematics@14.4.0 

  Ensure you install version 14.x of @angular-eslint/schematics in your ng 14 project

Routing in Angular 
-------------------
Step 0:
  Identify the pages, the URLs and the matching components

  Page              URL                                   Component 
  ==================================================================
  Home              localhost:4200                        HomeComponent
  Concepts          localhost:4200/concepts               ConceptsComponent
  Employees         localhost:4200/employees              EmployeesComponent
  About             localhost:4200/about-us               AboutUsComponent
  Contact           localhost:4200/contact                ContactComponent


Step 1: 
------
  goto menu-list.comp.html, setup the URL for the menus.

Step 2: 
------
  check the app. URL is not stable. Let's fix it by configuring the routes 
  For that, you need to know the components to be loaded for the urls 
  So, Let's create the components 

  ng g c home/components/home -t -s
  ng g c concepts/components/concepts -s
  ng g c employees/components/employees -s
  ng g c about/components/about-us -s -t 
  ng g c contact/components/contact -s -t 

Step 3:
------
  We can now config the routes in app-routing.module.ts 

Step 4:
------
  Check the app. URL is stable. But the component in between 
  header and footer is not getting loaded. Let's fix it. 
  in app.comp.html, let's use router-outlet 

Step 5: 
------
  Check the app. Component is loaded in between header and footer. 
  Now, let's fix the page refresh problem. 

  in menu-list.comp.html, replace href with routerLink.

Step 6:
----
  Check the app. There won't be any page refresh. 


====================================================

Data Binding
------------
  keep the data in comp ts and display it in comp.html 
  TS => HTML 

  1. Interpolation [DONE]
      TS => HTML 
      {{ }}

  2. Property Binding  [DONE]
      TS => HTML 
      []

      Learn about class binding  [ngClass]
      Learn about style binding  [ngStyle]

  3. Event Binding   [DONE]
      TS <== HTML
      ()

  4. Two Way Binding  [DONE]
      TS <=> HTML
      [(ngModel)]
      Note: You can use this in form elements only

  5. Custom Property Binding  [DONE]
  6. Custom Event Binding [DONE]

Cross Component Communication
---------
  1. Parent to Child Component Communication  [DONE]
      using Custom Property Binding

  2. Child to Parent Component Communication [PARTIALLY]
      2.1 using Custom Event Binding [DONE] (or)
      2.2 using @ViewChild() decorator [TODO]

  3. Any to Any Component Communication [PENDING]
      using Services, RxJS/Observables, Subcription

Debugging
----
  1. Compilation Error (during development)
      Check the terminal / cmd prompt        

  2. Runtime Error (during execution in browser)
      Check the browser console 


Directives
-----------
  1. Attribute Directives
     Examples: routerLink, routerLinkActive, 

  2. Structural Directives
      * Impacts of these directives can be seen in structure of the page (html)

      Examples: *ngIf, *ngFor, ngSwitch 

  3. Custom Attribute Directives
      ng g d <directive-name>

  4. Custom Structural Directives
      ng g d <directive-name>

==================

Angular Forms
=============
  1. Template-Driven Forms 
      * easiest 
      * can be built with HTML
      * you can use angular validator in the form of directives
      * it uses ngModel directive 

      Adv
      ----
        1. small learning curve 

      Disadv 
      -----
        1. Not suitable for complex validation 
        2. Not suitable for Unit Testing 


  2. Reactive Forms [RECOMMENDED]
      * easy 
      * can be built with HTML + TS
      * you can use angular validator and also use custom validators 

      Adv
      ----
        1. suitable for complex validation 
        2. suitable for Unit Testing 

      Disadv 
      -----
        1. larger learning curve
